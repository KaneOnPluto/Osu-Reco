# Osu! Reco

Osu! Reco is an open-source desktop application that recommends ranked osu! beatmaps based on a player’s global rank and selected game mode.

Instead of relying on a simple logarithmic approximation, the application uses a custom piecewise difficulty model designed to better reflect real player progression. Beatmaps are fetched directly from the official osu! API v2 and displayed in a clean, card-based interface with cover images.

There are many issues with this app since I'm new to python, feel free to help out and teach me more, or don't, I'll keep working on it!

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaneOnPluto/osu-reco.git
cd osu-reco
```
### Step 2: Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate it:

Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

MacOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### osu! API Setup (Required)

This application uses the official osu! API v2 and requires OAuth credentials.

### Step 4: Create an osu! OAuth application

1. Log in to your osu! account
2. Go to https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit
3. Scroll to the OAuth Applications section
4. Create a new application
5. Set the application type to Confidential
6. The redirect URL is not used and can be set to any valid URL

You will receive:

-> Client ID
-> Client Secret

### Step 3: Create your local config file

Copy the example configuration file:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```
Open config.json and insert your credentials:

```json
{
    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "access_token": "",
    "token_expiry": 0
}
```

### Running the Application

From the project directory, with your virtual environment activated:

```bash
python main.py
```
The application window should open.
